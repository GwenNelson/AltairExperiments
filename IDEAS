Editing a byte using the front panel sense switches and rotation
A13-A8 input
A14    shift left
A15    submit

Editing a byte using the front panel sense switches without rotation
A14-A8 input
raise A15
raise/lower A14 to set value of A15
lower A15
submitted

Editing a byte in 2 nibbles
A15 low  A11-A8 lower nibble
A15 high A11-A8 higher nibble

OS with all commands via sense switches

Simon says style game using sense switches

try to toggle the switch after exactly 10 seconds

use two sense switches as portals to move a bit around (just a bit of fun)

Z-machine text adventure engine (front panel only)

navigate a 2d landscape using the sense switches to move up,down,left and right (could be really cool)

monochrome raycaster (flashing bit is enemy?)
different frequencies of flashing could be different things
flash LEDs at different frequencies for different brightnesses
toggle switch up   > updates coordinates
toggle switch down > renders next frame

raycaster prototype static scene

light up each LED a different brightness as test for raycaster

1ms timer
for each bit:
	calculate whether it needs to be on or off based on the frequency it has assigned

simple prototype of PWM:
	at startup, light up a bit at maximum intensity
	setup timer interrupt for particular frequency
	every time the clock fires, invert the bit

sub timers
	interrupt fires every 1ms
	1ms == 1%
	duty cycle = 25%:
		every 75 cycles, switch on for 25 cycles
	duty cycle = 50%:
		every 50 cycles, switch on for 50 cycles

every clock tick, update display register immediately
use display_out with minimal delay

increment HL pair by 1 only
ldax 4 times after each increment

clock period is 0xFFFF

use single 8-bit register
	instead of dad d:
	inr b (increment 8-bit register)

when b carries:
	1 clock tick
	check for bits to invert, check the bit's counter and decrement 1
	if a bit is on 25% duty cycle:
		if high, switch state to low and set counter to 75
		if low,  switch state to high and set counter to 25
	ldax d to update display


1D image viewer
different brightnesses == different colors
sense switches to scroll up and down
port to digirule or similar?

Chrome dinosaur style game

Save the bit: the bit will move continously (i.e. Kill The Bit), another bit will appear at random and you need to press any switch the moment the two bits hit. Could get harder over time?
