OS with all commands via sense switches

Simon says style game using sense switches
try to toggle the switch after exactly 10 seconds
use two sense switches as portals to move a bit around (just a bit of fun)
Z-machine text adventure engine (front panel only)
navigate a 2d landscape using the sense switches to move up,down,left and right (could be really cool)
