This is a simple script that produces a relocatable executable using the .reloc file from z80asm.

Once done, a new .asm file is produced that contains a relocation routine and the original .bin file.

This routine requires the load address in H:L.

To test, do this:

asm2reloc relocfile binfile >reloc.asm
z80asm -m8080 -b reloc.asm
cat reloc.bin binfile >reloc2.bin
srec_cat reloc2.bin -binary -offset 0x100 -o reloc.hex -intel
asm8080 jmp2reloc.asm

now load jmp2reloc.hex and reloc.hex into the altair
