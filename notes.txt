single bit test:
	put value to test in A
	ani 01h            ; test rightmost bit
	jz something       ; jump to something if the bit is zero
	jnz something_else ; jump to something else if the bit is not zero (i.e set)

entering a byte via front panel:
	set A8
	set A9 up and back down

converting a .bin to a .ihex:
	objcopy -v -I binary -O ihex cylon.bin cylon.ihex

zcc calling convention:
	push params one at a time
	caller cleans up stack
	return value is in hl
	e.g
		bios(1,2,3)

	; push params one at a time
	mvi hl,1
	push hl
	mvi hl,2
	push hl
	mvi hl,3
	push hl
	
	call bios
	
	pop bc
	pop bc
	pop bc
	
	; return value is in hl
